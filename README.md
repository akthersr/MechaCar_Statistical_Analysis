# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview of the project

Jeremy, was invited by upper management team for the MechaCar,the AutosRUs’ newest prototype, which was suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. Jeremy and the data analytics team are going to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team of the MechaCar.

The main objectives are as follows:

-To identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes by performing multiple linear regression analysis.

-Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.

-Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.

-Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars.Here we perform multiple linear regression using the lm() function. In the lm() function, pass in all six variables (such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, AWD,mpg and ground clearance).The independent variables are as follows:
